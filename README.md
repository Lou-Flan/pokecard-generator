# pokecard-generator
POKEAPI, PUG, SCSS &amp; JAVASCRIPT. Click the Pokeball to generate a random pokecard!

This random pokemon card generator is an experiment using APIs, asynchronous JS, promises and animations.


To-Do:
- Add function that converts users name into a Pokemon Id
- Clean up functions

Challenges
âœ… As the pokemon images some times take a while to load, I wanted an animation to play while they load in the background. I found this tricky but promises saved the day :)
